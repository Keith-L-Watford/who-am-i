# Portfolio (v2)

## Description
I wanted to create a new portfolio, using some of the new tools Ive learned. I also wanted to challenge myself and work with a new-to-me CSS framework. I decided to use Bulma (https://bulma.io/documentation/). I found it to be very easy to pick up and I was mostly able to create what I originally had in my wireframe.

## Credits
Shout out to my tutor Scott (https://github.com/smack322) for giving me some early career advice and some tips and tricks for LinkedIn and building a resum√©.

## Notes
Im super happy with how this draft turned out. Using Bulma made the process so efficient and easy. The next thing I would like to look into for this project is the white space in the mobile version of the website.
